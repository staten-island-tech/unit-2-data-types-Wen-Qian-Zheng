# # Strings operate like lists
# x = "Hello Freshman, you all smell"
# print(x[0])

# So when you do that ^ since the count starts at 0, it takes the first letter, H

# y = x.upper()
# print(y)

# ^ NOW THEY'RE ALL IN CAPS WOAH

# words_list = x.split(",")
# print(words_list)

# So here, it found that comma and split the string based on where the comma is

# words_list = x.split(" ")
# print(words_list)

# ^ In this way, we can find how many spaces there are and it would separate
# Das cool

# words_list = x.split()
# print(len(words_list))

# So if you do that you find how many words there are in a sentence
